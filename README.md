authentication backends, focusing on simplicity and ease of use compared to more 
_comprehensive_ solutions like Apereo CAS.

## Features

- CAS v2 Protocol Support
- LDAP Authentication Backend
- Static Authentication Backend
- Session Management for Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Secure Handling of Credentials and Tickets

## Prerequisites

## Running the Server

Instructions on how to install and run the server will be added when the project
has progressed further.
